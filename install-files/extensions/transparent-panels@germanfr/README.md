## Themes supported
Transparent panels supports every theme in principle, but there are some themes that may not fit well. For such cases, the authors (or users) of the theme may override the `panel-transparent` class in their `cinnamon.css`, which can be enabled in the extension preferences.

## Installation
### Cinnamon Spices
Download it [from here][spices] or search for _"Transparent panels"_ in your Cinnamon extension settings.
### From source
To download the source and install it, execute the following as a normal user (you will need [git](https://git-scm.com/)).
``` bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels.git
$ cd cinnamon-transparent-panels/ && ./install.sh
```
The above will download the source from GitHub and it will be copied to your `~/.local/share/cinnamon/extensions/` folder. If you don't have git installed, you can download a zip [from here](https://github.com/germanfr/cinnamon-transparent-panels/archive/master.zip). Run `./install.sh` from the folder extracted from the zip.
